# Communities

This module contains functions for community detection algorithms and related operations.
Most code is derived from the [Graph
Communities Julia Package](https://github.com/RandyRDavila/GraphCommunities.jl).
Algorithms include label propagation, pagerank, k-clique, and others. The module also
includes other methods for graph construction, community analysis, and visualization.
